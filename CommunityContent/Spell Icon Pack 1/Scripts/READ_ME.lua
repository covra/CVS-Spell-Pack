	Hi.

	Each icon is 128 x 128 px but scaled down to 64 x 64 px.

	I made a template for each icon so it's easy to just drag and drop into the hierarchy.

	Icons come from: https://opengameart.org/content/painterly-spell-icons-part-1

	There is an example template you can drop in to see all of them.

	If you would prefer to host the pack for yourself, you can download the texture atlases:

	- Create a blank project
	- Publish game as unlisted
	- Use the image you downloaded as the screenshot

	To use in a project:

	- Create UI Image
	- Set "Game ID" to the slug of your unlisted game (i.e "81d2f7/spell-icon-pack-1")
	- Select screenshot index 
	- Set the size of the image and x / y offset
